   * the same name - this blueprint would run with an empty class here. It exists to show
   * the hook: the aggregate VanillaBP built is handed in, together with a
   * {@link BpmsStartTrigger} saying what fired, and whatever is written here is saved with
   * it in the same transaction.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Without {@code id} the method serves every BPMS-initiated start event of the process,
   * which is what a process with one such event needs. This one has two, and both are meant
   * to end up in the same aggregate, so no id is named. Naming one
   * ({@code @WorkflowStartedByBpms(id = "StartEvent_ScheduledReview")}) is how the two would
   * be told apart.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Throwing here means the workflow does not start: the aggregate is rolled back and the
   * BPMS applies its retry semantics.
