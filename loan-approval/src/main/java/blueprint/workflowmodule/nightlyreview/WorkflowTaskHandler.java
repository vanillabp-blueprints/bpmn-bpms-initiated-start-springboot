   * Called by VanillaBP when the engine started this workflow by itself.

   * <p>
   * <b>The annotation is required for a process the BPMS can start on its own.</b> A timer,
   * a signal or a condition may fire for this process, and without this method the
   * application refuses to boot, naming the process and the method to write. The check runs
   * while the models are deployed, so a missing method is found then and not at three in the
   * morning.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * The method BUILDS the aggregate and returns it. Nobody handed one in, because nothing of
   * the application has seen this workflow yet, and an object VanillaBP had instantiated
   * would carry none of the application's values. The ID it picks is the ID of the workflow:
   * the BPMS is told about it and finds the aggregate under it from here on.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Without {@code id} the method serves every BPMS-initiated start event of the process,
   * which is what a process with one such event needs. This one has two, and both are meant
   * to end up in the same aggregate, so no id is named. Naming one
   * ({@code @WorkflowStartedByBpms(id = "StartEvent_ScheduledReview")}) is how the two would
   * be told apart.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Throwing here means the workflow does not start: the aggregate is rolled back and the
   * BPMS applies its retry semantics.
   * </p>
   *
   * @param trigger What made the BPMS start this workflow.
   * @return The aggregate of the review, which VanillaBP saves.
